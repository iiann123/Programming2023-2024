Modules are pieces of code that we can borrow in python 
This includes things like function


> For example, in random we used .choice() function to choose something randomly from lists

These pieces of code are not automatically included so we need to import them into our code explicitly
# Import
the import keyowrd loads the module into our python file import should be at the top of our file, under the header

# The time module
Time allows us to play around with anything related to time Specifically , we can use time to pause our code
