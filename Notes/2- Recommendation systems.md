popularity and likes

This is a type of paradigm


how many people "like" the thing

one example of this is the like button (heart) in instagram. When you click on that heart button, Instagram records it somewhere along with other data like demographic and psychographic information. With this information they might suggest other users similar to you, products and services that you like

We implemented the Popularity/Likes paradigm with our favourite bubble tea activity 

# N-Point Rating System

N-point rating systems are used by many services particularly Jeff Bezos' baby, Amazon.
 HIs paradigm provides more granular information. Buyers are asked to rate the product on a five point scale


## Similarity Score

Amazon Meta TikTok Netflix all use similarity sores to help drive and keep users on their platforms

Example
Amazon

>Ubial likes ["nintendo switch", "Usb pd chargers" , "4k blu ray movies"
>Ben likes [" nintendo switch", "Usb pd chargers", "Lego"]
>Fido likes ["lego", "chew toys", "fuzzy slippers"]]

similarity scores indicate how similar two people are to each other.
Ben and Ubial have a similarity score of 2 (they like two things that are the same)
Ubial and Fido have a similarity score of 0. Ben and fido have a similarity score of 1
