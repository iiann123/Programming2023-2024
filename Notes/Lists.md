In python, lists are a collection of items 
We store values inside of lists
The value of the items can be of different [[Types]]
**Order** matters in a list

# Creating a List 
To make a list, we use brackets \[]\ to surround our list
We separate the individual items with commas

```python
some_list = ["jimmy", "Sara" , " Frederique"]
some_list.append("POOP")
```
# Accessing elements in the lists
We can access the individual things from lists using bracket notation in the example below, we'll use bracket notation to access "sara"
``
``` python
some_list[1] #sara
some_list[0] # jimmy
some_list[2] #Frederiuque
```

# 2 dimensional lists

so far all the list we used so far are one dimensional

```python
some_list = ["dadad", "dasdas"]
```

we can create two dimensional lists that in short are multiple lists inside bigger list
are multiple lists inside a bigger list

```python
some_2d_list = [
	[1,2,3]
	[]
				
]
```

# Tuples

tuples are like lists except for one main thing

Tuples are imutable. Immutable
