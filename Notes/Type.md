In python Data can be grouped in categories called **types** 

| Name             | Example         |
| ----                |----|          
| string or str.  | "hello world"
| list.                 | [1, 2,3, 4,]
| Boolean or bool | true or false
| integer or int | 1, -10 , 1205
| float | 1.2 -432.21 1.0

An example showing the use of these names: 

```python
 favourite_food = "bibimbap"
 my_age = 16
 my_age_float =. 16.0dd
```


# Converting types

There are some special functions built in to Python that helps to convert data from one type to another

```python 
intro_string = "My name is"
my_age = 16

#recall

"My name is " + "Jim #My name isJim

"mu name is" + "" + "JIm
```
